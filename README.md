# ReadMe-gen

# Description

I built this project to give the user an easier way to create a readme file for their project. Using the command line interface Inquirer.js the user is issued a series of prompts relevant to completing a readme. This includes prompts such as "What is the name of your project?" and "Please enter your github link name". The application includes a table of contents and sections for "Description", "Contributing and Tests", "Installation and Usage", and "Questions".

# Installation

To install this application the user must install the Inquirer.js dependency. Run 'npm @inquirer8.2.4' to install. The application code can be cloned by following this link: https://github.com/taylorgr92/readme-gen.

# Usage

In order to use the application the user must run the in-line command 'node assets/index.js' to initiate Inquirer.js. A series of prompts will then appear that takes user input to create an index.html file. Once all of the prompts have been answered the index.html file will be created and can be view in the browser.
